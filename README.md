## Useful Monorepo Operations

### Setup

Install the dependencies for all workspaces in the monorepo

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Clean

Remove all generated `build` artifacts for all workspaces in the monorepo

```shell
pnpm run -w clean
```

### Build

Produce final generated artifacts for deployment for all relevant workspaces in the monorepo
> [!NOTE]
> Not all workspaces in the monorepo have or need `build`tasks

```shell
pnpm run -w build
```

### Test

Run unit tests for all workspaces in the monorepo

```shell
pnpm run -w test
```

### Lint

Run unit tests for all workspaces in the monorepo

```shell
pnpm run -w lint
```

### Type Check

Run TypeScript type checks for all workspaces in the monorepo

```shell
pnpm run -w typecheck
```

## Building Docker Image
```shell
docker build . -t sveltekit-example-app
```
```shell
docker run --rm --name=sveltekit-example-app -p 8080:3000 sveltekit-example-app
```

## Conventional Commits Best Practices

Commit messages must adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) best practices. The format
proposed by this convention leads to easier to read
commit history.

Each commit message consists of a header, a body, and a footer.

### Default

<pre>
<b><a href="#types">&lt;type&gt;</a></b>(<b><a href="#scopes">&lt;optional scope&gt;</a></b>): <b><a href="#subject">&lt;subject&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#body">&lt;optional body&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#footer">&lt;optional footer&gt;</a></b>
</pre>

### Scopes

The `scope` provides additional contextual information.

* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Allowed Scopes depends on the specific project
* Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

### Subject

The `subject` contains a succinct description of the change.

* Is a **mandatory** part of the format
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* Do not capitalize the first letter
* No dot (.) at the end

### Body

The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* This is the place to mention issue identifiers and their relations

### Footer

The `footer` should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to **reference Issues**
that this commit refers to.

* Is an **optional** part of the format
* **optionally** reference an issue by its id.
* **Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGES:` followed by space or two newlines. The rest of the
  commit message is then used for this.

### Examples

* ```
  feat(shopping cart): add the amazing button
  ```
* ```
  feat: remove ticket list endpoint
  
  refers to JIRA-1337
  BREAKING CHANGES: ticket enpoints no longer supports list all entites.
  ```
* ```
  fix: add missing parameter to service call
  
  The error occurred because of <reasons>.
  ```
* ```
  build(release): bump version to 1.0.0
  ```
* ```
  build: update dependencies
  ```
* ```
